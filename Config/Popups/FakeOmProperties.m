function varargout = FakeOmProperties(varargin)
% FAKEOMPROPERTIES M-file for FakeOmProperties.fig
%      FAKEOMPROPERTIES, by itself, creates a new FAKEOMPROPERTIES or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = FAKEOMPROPERTIES returns the handle to a new FAKEOMPROPERTIES or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      FAKEOMPROPERTIES('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in FAKEOMPROPERTIES.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      FAKEOMPROPERTIES('Property','Value',...) creates a new FAKEOMPROPERTIES or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before FakeOmProperties_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to FakeOmProperties_OpeningFcn via varargin.
