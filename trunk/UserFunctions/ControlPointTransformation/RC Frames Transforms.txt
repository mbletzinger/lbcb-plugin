The LbcbPlugin allows the commands and responses between UI-SimCor and the LBCB to be transformed through the use of MATLAB plugin functions.  
The use of the plugins a described here:  http://nees.uiuc.edu/software/docs/LbcbPlugin%20Data%20Organization.docx

The function RcFramesTransformCommand transforms the command from UI-SimCor from model coordinates to LBCB coordinates.

The function RcFramesTransformResponse transforms the displacement and force readings from the LBCB into model coordinates.  
It creates the fake response if configured.

The functions scale_command and scale_command_response are used to scale the commands and responses based on configurable scale factors.

The LbcbPlugin software allows the use of configuration variables that can modify the behavior of the plugins during the test.  
The following configuration variables are used in the RC Frames transformation functions:

FakeResponse - 1 if the response is calculated based on stiffness and the displacement commands. 
			   0 if the response should come from the LBCB force readings.

Stiffness.Dx, Stiffness.Dy, Stiffness.Dz, Stiffness.Rx, Stiffness.Ry, Stiffness.Rz - The stiffness of the 6 degrees of freedom in model coordinates.

Displacement.Scale, Rotation.Scale, Force.Scale, Moment.Scale - Scaling factors for the four different DOF types.

There are three different coordinate systems between OpenSees and the LBCB Cartesian space.  
UI-SimCor hard codes the column as a cantilever beam when it runs as an element of OpenSees. 
The coordinate matrices are as follows:

OpenSees -> UI-SimCor
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
[1 0 0]
UI-SimCor -> LbcbPlugin
[0 0 -1]
[0 -1 0]
[-1 0 0]

For the 1/5 scale the translations (Dx, Dy, Dz) need to be converted from meters to inches:
Tlbcb = Tmodel * 39.37 * 0.2
The rotations are not scaled.

Forces are scaled depending on the stiffness of the small scale specimen and a unit conversion from pounds to kilonewtons
Fmodel = Flbcb * 4.449 / 1000
Moments are also scaled depending on the stiffness of the small scale specimen and a unit conversion form lb*in to kN-m
Mmodel = Mlbcb / (8.847 * 1000)

Stiffness values for the fake response test come from the NICA configuration of the analytical model of the test column found in the config_1.txt file. 
The matrix is used after the response displacements are transformed and scaled back to UI-SimCor space
