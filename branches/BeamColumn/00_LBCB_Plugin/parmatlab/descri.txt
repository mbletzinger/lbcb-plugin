  Name:    parmatlab   v1.77 Beta 11/01
  Summary: This toolbox distributes processes over matlab workers available over the
           intranet/internet. This toolbox implements a SPMD parallel architecture 
           model.
 
 
  NEW IN v1.77 ---> Solved bugs when tx/rx cells, structs, and sparse 
               ---> Now, also can tx/rx int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32 and uint32.
  
  Still missing: Capability of tx/rx objects.
                 Warning: When using chars of 16 bits, it will not tx/rx the HO byte
 
 
  New in v1.7: ---> Real CROSS-PLATAFORMS, CROSS-OS and CROSS-Matlab versions !, 
                    tested with Solarisv, linux, win98, winNT, win200, matlab 5.3 & matlab 6
               ---> Error handling capabilities, you can debug the workspace of a worker if 
                    it had an error and without stopping the other workers or the majordomo
               ---> Improved demo which explains how to use basic functions to implement also
                    a MPMD parallel architecture model  
               ---> Capability of re-use data which was already transmitted to the workers 
                    worspace
    
  New in v1.05: --> Better explained demo files to introduce faster the user to the tool
 
  Important note: I have received lots of e-mail with ideas to improve this toolbox, I'll
                  appreciate if you send me an e-mail explaining your application, to plan
                  future improvments.
     
    Description:
        This toolbox distributes processes over matlab workers available over the
        intranet/internet. These workers must be running a matlab daemon to be accessed. 
 
        This tool is very useful for corsely granular parallelization problems and in the
        precesence of a distributed and heterogeneus computer enviroment. You can operate 
        the toolbox in twomodes:
  
        [MPMD mode] Multiple program-Multiple Data parallel model; the user has the control 
        to send different matlab tasks to remote machines simultaneusly and retraive results
        later.  
 
        [SPMD mode] Single program-Multiple Data parallel model; parallelization and managment 
        of remote workers is done automatically. Input data must be regularly ordered in
        matlab hyperblocks. 
 
        1) You DO NOT need a common file system, all communications between tasks (tx of
        commands/data) are througth tcpip connections. 
        2) The parallel virtual machine does not need to know which workers are available,
        it'll will be listening until workers report ready. New workers can be added even if 
        the process has been started. 
        3) Parallelization can be done over different dimensions (up to 5) at the same time
        and using contiguous, overlapping or constant hyper-blocks. Indexes can also vary for
        different input variables, the only restriction is that the total number of parallel
        elements should be the same. 
        4) Tcpip TOOLBOX 1.2.3 by Peter Rydesater is used for communications, but some 
        improvments have been done to avoid file writing to serialize data before tx. 
        Instead, serialization of data is achieved with a low-level MEX file. Serial data to 
        Matlab variables is also done with a MEX file. The latest version of the Tcpip toolbox 
        is not available in the Mathworks site, I included  version 1.2.3 in this 
        distribution, but you should visit http://petrydpc.itm.mh.se/tools and check
        if there is a newer version available.
 
        Note 1: Please refer to the demos to understand how the tool is used 
        Note 2: Timeout utilities  will be added in a future version. 
        Note 3: Capability to manipulate data in remote workers will be added in a future
                version. But it is not clear for me yet if it is really needed.
