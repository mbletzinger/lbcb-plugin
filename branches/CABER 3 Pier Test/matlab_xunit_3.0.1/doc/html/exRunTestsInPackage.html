%% How to Run Tests in a Package
% To run all the test cases in a package, give the name of the
% package as an argument to |runtests|.

% For example, suppose you are distributing a set of MATLAB files called the
% "ABC Toolbox." Then you could put your tests inside a package called abc_tests
% and run them like this:

runtests abc_tests

%%
% (Note that the initial "+" character in the name of the package folder on disk
% is not part of the package name.)

% Or you could put your tests inside a subpackage called abc.tests and run them
% like this:

runtests abc.tests
